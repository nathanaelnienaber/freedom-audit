// tmrw audit - Type Definitions
// Why this exists: To ensure type safety and consistency across the tmrw audit toolâ€™s modules for reliable data handling.
// What it does: Defines TypeScript interfaces (VendorService, ScanResults) for services, scores, and audit results.
// How it works: Provides structured types for vendor services and scan results, used by scanner, analyzer, and report modules to enforce data integrity.
// Part of the TMRW Manifesto for user-owned, unchained  infrastructure.
